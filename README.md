# Course-project-NYPD-misconduct
This is a course project focuses on the misconduct complaints against the NYPD, investigating questions related to the disciplinary actions given to police officers accused of various types of misconduct. Two core questions for this project project are: _**What factors explain whether police officers are penalized or not for their misconduct?**_ And _**in these officers who got penalties, what factors explain the different penalties given to police officers?**_

The (NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database)[https://www.nyclu.org/data/nypd-misconduct-database], constructed by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), will serve as the primary dataset for this project. This dataset includes 302,801 unique complaint records covering 107,187 incidents since 2000. It features basic descriptions of incidents, such as complaint categories and associated allegations. More importantly, it records the names of police officers involved in misconduct, as well as the types of NYPD penalties imposed on these officers. Additionally, this dataset includes demographic information regarding the race of both officers and impacted individuals, which enables the analysis of interactions between different racial groups. The raw data can be accessed from the GitHub repository (here)[https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated].
